### Problem:

How can Maaike Girardin be best represented with her style so that her upcoming and past events can be seen and there are highlights of her music?

<b> -- Home </b> - which the user sees upon opening the website. There are links to her social media

<b> -- About Me </b> - a description for Maaike Girardin which explains what her style is and what type of music she makes.

<b>-- Listen Now</b> - includes an interactive vinyl player where the user can drag & drop different vinyls to the player thus playing different songs of Maaike Girardin

<b>-- Events</b> - leads to both Maaike's past and upcoming events

<b>-- Contact Me</b> - anyone interested to collaborate or get in touch with Maaike can send her a message.
