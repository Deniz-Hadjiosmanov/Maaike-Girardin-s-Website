                    I have previous experience with programming but only the basics.
                    Motivated and dedicated, always searching for new things to learn and try.

                <p>A very hard-working and passionate student. I always want to know more and more about web
                    development. My hobby is reading books and my favourite author is Jane Austen. I am obssesed with
                    fashion and make-up and I like trying new things.

                    (English and German).
                    I also have a little prior programming experience. Now I want to go into detail in the world of
                    front-end development. When I graduate, I plan to start my company since I am also interested in
                    business.
