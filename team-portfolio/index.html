                    I have previous experience with programming but only the basics.
                    Motivated and dedicated, always searching for new things to learn and try.

                    I also have a little prior programming experience. Now I want to go into detail in the world of
                    front-end development. When I graduate, I plan to start my company since I am also interested in
                    business.
